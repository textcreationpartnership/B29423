            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

(at, and before which time the Patrons were most injuriously dispossest of their Patronages) Have no right unto, nor uplift the Rents of their respective Benefices, modified Stipends, Manse, or Gleb, for this instant year of God 1662. Nor for any year following, unless they should obtain a Presentation from the lawfull Patron, and have Collation from the Bishop of the Dioces where he liveth, before the twenty of September last: As likewise, That it is statute and ordained, that the 29. day of May should be yearly keeped as a holy day unto the Lord, for a solemn anniversary Thanksgiving for his Majesties restauration to his royall Government: And that all Ministers of the Gospel should accordingly observe the same in their respective Paroches, under the pains therein contained. Yet several Ministers not only have contraveened the foresaids Acts of Parliament, but in manifest contempt of His Majesties royall authority, albeit they have justly forefaulted their right to the Benefices, modified Stipends, and others, continue to exerce the Function of the Ministery at their respective Churches, as of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Therefore they prohibite and discharge all Ministers who have contraveened the foresaid act of Parliament concerning the Benefices and Stipends, to exerce any part of the Function of the Ministery at their respective Churches in time coming, which are hereby declared to be vacand: And that none of their Parochiners who are lyable in any part of their Stipends make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them of this instant Crop and year of God 1662. Or in time coming, as having no right thereto: And that they do not acknowledge them for their lawfull Pastor, in repairing to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, under the pain of being punished as frequenters of private Conventicles and Meetings. And Commands and Charges the saids Ministers to remove themselves and their Families out of their Paroches, betwixt and the first day of November next, and not to reside within the bounds of their respective Presbyteries. As likewise, that no Heretor or other lyable in payment of any part of the Ministers Stipend make payment to any Minister who have contraveened the foresaid Act of Parliament forkeeping the anniversary Thanksgiving, of any part of this years Stipend. And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, That the Ministers who have contraveened the said Act, shall be lyable to the whole pains therein contained. And ordains these presents be forthwith printed and published by the Sheriffs of Shires, and Magistrates of Burghs, that none may pretend ignorance.</p>
